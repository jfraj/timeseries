Time series
Characteristics
* Dependence on past only (but obviously future can give insight into the past)

# TS Layout
## Observations
| timestamp | Key | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2016-01-01 | A | 0.1 |
| 2016-01-01 | B | 0.5 |
| 2016-01-02 | B | 0.6 |
| 2016-01-03 | A | 0.2 |

Need `groupBy` to look at a moment in time => expensive espescially in distributed system.

---

# TS Layout
## Instant
| timestamp | A | B | C |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2016-01-01 | 0.1 | 0.2 | 0.3 |
| 2016-01-02 | 0.3 | 0.3 | 0.6 |

Good for if each row considered as an independant data point.
Not so good with distributed system if you want to connect with time,
e.g. expensive if previous row (time) is in a different partition.

---

# TS Layout
## Row = univariate time series

| dateTimeIndex | [2016-01-01, 2016-01-02, ...]|
| --- | --- |
| **Key** | **Series** |
| A | [0.1, 0,2, 0.3] |
| B | [0.3, NaN, 0.6] |

In many applications, a single time series will easily fit in memory.

#Selected topics of Time series

- Counting time series
- Forcasting

## Counting time series
From this `R` package [description](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tscount/vignettes/tsglm.pdf)
Examples:
- Number hospital admissions per day
- Number of particle emmitted per second by radiative material
- Number of clicks per day

All of the above have a different model of production, but they all comprise **non-negative** number of event.
---

## Counting time series
Possible approaches
- (Generalized) Linear Model (G)LM
  - Well defined model assesment and forcasting
- (integer) Auto Regressive Moving Average ARMA

### Linear model
from [here](https://www.u-cergy.fr/_resources/Documents%2520SDRV/documents%2520IEA/Fokianos_CTSM.pdf)
and [here](http://www.planta.cn/forum/files_planta/glm_2002_crc_213.pdf)
http://data.princeton.edu/wws509/notes/c4.pdf

Ordinary regression of linear model does not take into account the discret nature of counting (e.g. there is no fractional clicks).
A natural starting point is the **Poisson regression**.

Poisson distribution models probability the number of events y for a given random value
$$P(Y=y) = \frac{m^{r}e^{-m}}{y!}$$
where
* `m` is the mean rate for the given interval
* y = 1,2,3...

Note1: mean and variance happen to both be `m` for Poisson.
Note2: The sum of 2 (independant) poisson process is also a poisson process
#### Warning:
The poisson distribution is actually a limiting form of the **binomial** distribution
with mean `m = N*p` where `N` is the number of trial and `p` the probability.
There are 3 possibilities:
- `N` is small: Then go with the actual binomial
- `N` and `p` are large : use the gaussian, integers can be considered continuous when numbers are large.
  - Rule of thumb : `N>30` and `p > 0.05`
- `N` large and `p` small

Concretly, `N` could be the number of impressions and `p` be the probability of getting a click.
The typical numbers of impressions and clicks fits the predicate of Poisson distribution.

### Poisson regression
Suppose we have `n` events with value `\( y_i = \{y_{1}, y_{2}... y_{n}\} \)`
We want to find a linear parameter `\(\beta_{i}\)` mapping the time to get the mean `\(m_{i}\)`

#### Simple linear model

$$m_i = \beta_i * x_i $$

Does not exclude negative average.

#### log-linear model

$$log(m_i) = \beta_i * x_i $$

Never the mean is never negative

# Tools

- R

---

##Some functionality


- Exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) models
- Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models
- Generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic (GARCH) models
- Missing data imputation
- Augmented Dickey-Fuller test
  - To test if TS is stationary
- Durbin-Watson test
  - To test auto correlation
- Breusch-Godfrey test
  - To test assumptions in regression model
- Breusch-Pagan test
  - tests whether the estimated variance of the residuals from a regression are dependent on the values of the independent variables.

## Time series RDD
extends `rdd: RDD[String, Vector[Double]`
index `DateTimeIndex`

---

## Forcasting
### The naive approach, every event are independant
- Linear regression: All points are equal, yesterday just as important as last year.
- Poisson

Tools
- Spark TS method (mentioned earlier)
- R seems to be the most complete include tscounting
- Python: seems to be behind R

# Display and Inline

1. This is an inline integral: `\(\int_a^bf(x)dx\)`
2. More `\(x={a \over b}\)` formulae.

Display formula:

$$e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$$
